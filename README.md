# Desciption
EDITH: The Employee Depression Detection System using Emotion Detection by Haar Cascade and Questions & Answers is a standalone system that will be used to detect 
depression in employees in an organization. The system will integrate data collected from emotion detection algorithms and a well-designed questionnaire to provide a comprehensive assessment of an employee's mental health status at primary level. 

# Solution
EDITH is a system that identifies the depression or anxiety level of the employee or user by detecting his or her emotions through the camera and segregating them into positive and negative emotions. If the detected emotions are positive, he or she is in a good mental state, and if the detected emotions are negative or neutral, then it will prompt the employee or user to take a short survey of the day in which there will be questions referred to by a certified therapist that will help to assess his or her mental health at the primary level. This system provides the employer with a better assessment of his or her employees, through which the employer can work to manage the work load for a better future.
